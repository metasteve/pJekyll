"content"  : "Taken from the readme file of the project’s Github repository)A Jekyll theme built with Google’s Polymer library and following the material design specifications.There are a few custom web components included designed to match Material design.I created this theme because I couldn’t figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn’t find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google’s material design specifications.Features  Full-text search with simple-jekyll-search  Paginated home page  Support for featured post images (appears on cards in previews)  Threaded comments with Disqus  Google Analytics integrationInstallation instructions(Instructions are based off of those for the Polymer Starter Kit.)  Clone this repository or download it as a .zip file and unzip.  Install jekyll (and any other Ruby gems) with bundle install. (Prerequisite: must have Ruby installed. You may also have to install bundler with gem install bundler.)  From the project root folder, run npm install -g gulp bower &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bower install. (See the Polymer Starter Kit installation instructions for more details or troubleshooting.)Structure  app/: All Jekyll content is here. (This is where all the editing happens)          bower_components: Content installed via bower ends up here      elements/: Custom web components using Polymer      images/: User images      ‘media/’: Other user content (PDFs, videos, etc.) for final product      scripts/: Javascript files      styles/: Custom CSS        dist/: Built output from Gulp. (Use to publish static content)  node_modules: Content installed via npm goes hereDeploymentServe/watchgulp serve: Starts a jekyll serve process on the default port (4000 or whatever is specified in _config.yml).gulp serve --port 6666: Start serving on port 6666gulp serve:dist: Build as below, and serve the result from the dist/ directory. (Useful for testing changes to the gulpfile.)Build and vulcanizegulp: Builds the files with jekyll, vulcanizes, minimizes, and puts the result in the dist/ directory. (This can be slow.)Deploygulp deploy-gh-pages: Deploy the current build to the gh-pages branch of your repository.gulp build-deploy-gh-pages: Rebuild and then deploy. (Equivalent to gulp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gulp deploy-gh-pages)Future Improvements:  Improve gulp build          Minimize JS, CSS, HTML        Search          Ripple effect in search results on click (needs set height)      Escape toggles search show      arrow keys/tab moves focus on search results      better animation for search bar leaving/entering        Navigation drawer          Change hover effect on drawer items (see Google Music)      Make selected/active items in drawer colored        Page transition animations  Give option of setting card-colorbar color  Add ripple effect to nav drawer menu items  Pagination:          Maybe replace with actual buttons      hover effects like buttons?      Handle if it gets too wide for screen? (limit number of page links)        Tags          Show tags with posts      Allow filtering by tag        Add material box or lightbox for images  Add ‘source’ option for YAML frontmatter  increase spacing between list items  Fix things like header-panel to utilize updates to polymer paper elementsKnown issues  JS and HTML aren’t minimized  Too much space on cards between end of excerpt and read more button"

To see how to create them, check out the source markdown file.HeadingsHeading 1Heading 2Heading 3Heading 4Heading 5Heading 6TablesMarkdown Extra has a special syntax for tables:            Item      Value                  Computer      1600 USD              Phone      12 USD              Pipe      1 USD      You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:            Item      Value      Qty                  Computer      1600 USD      5              Phone      12 USD      12              Pipe      1 USD      234      Lists  Item 1  Item 2          Subitem 2.1      Subitem 2.2        Item 3BlockquotesYou can write block quotes.  This is a block quote.It’s split over multiple lines.  It can also have multiple paragraphs.Math (with MathJax)You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using MathJax, as on math.stackexchange.com:There are inline equations like ( y = x + 2 ) indicated by ( ... ).You can also display an equation (not inline displayed) using inline code, like [ y = x + 4] which you do with [ ... ].Or you can display a block of math by surrounding it with $$ ... $$. Like this:  Tip: Make sure you include MathJax into your publications to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like:&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;CodeInline codeCode embedded in a paragraph looks like this is code. Code can also be in blocks with or without line numbers.Code blocksCode blocks have syntax highlighting courtesy of highlight.js. You can specify the code language and whether you want the code block to include line numbers. (You can include line numbers using just linenos instead of linenos=table, but this puts the line numbers in the same lines as the code so that it becomes impossible to copy and paste.)Without line numbers:  def print_hi(name)    puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;  end  print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)  #=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT. This is a long line to test scrolling if it goes past the box.With line numbers:12345  def print_hi(name)    puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;  end  print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)  #=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.Definition ListsMarkdown Extra has a special syntax for definition lists too:  Term 1  Term 2  Definition A  Definition B  Term 3      Definition C        Definition D          part of definition D      DividersDivide up sections and stuff with dividers.They look like that.Font weights and stylesThis text is bold text.This is italicized text.Links and FootnotesYou can create footnotes like this1.You can embed links with a direct link, like this link to Google. Links can also be in a separated form like this link to the Jekyll documention. (That’s useful if you want to link to the same website multiple times like this.)            Here is the text of the footnote. &amp;#8617;      "
